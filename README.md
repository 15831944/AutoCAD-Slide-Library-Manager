Autodesk Slide Library Manager Application ( SLM )
=======================
Slm is a utility which helps you to create, edit, and manage AutoCAD slide libraries. 
It can read any version of AutoCAD slides, or slide libraries. 
It can also read any slide format (platform dependent such as UNIX, MAC, INTEL), and convert them into PNG transparent images.


The WPF Slide Control
=======================
The â€˜Slide' control is a WPF control which displays slides under Windows platforms.
It can be used by any other WPF application. It exposes three objects which are:
